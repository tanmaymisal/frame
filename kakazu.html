    <pre style="color: red;text-align: center;">Kakuzu was greedy and miserly individual. 
        He would arrange goals in terms of the highest profit he could gain from them, and was often unwilling to involve himself in something if there was nothing to gain from it, as well as claiming that he tended to forget opponents who were not worth any money after he was done with them.
         He even remarked that money is the only dependable thing in the world.
          Due to this end, he referred to himself as the "Treasurer of Akatsuki".
           Given his friendly relationship with Zangei, his bounty officer, it would seem he collected bounties rather frequently to earn cash, and did so (or at least tried) during his missions on several occasions. 
           The frequent side-tasks and devotion to money were both major points of contention between Hidan and Kakuzu. 
           He also seemed to respect an opponent who thinks well, as shown with his reaction to Kakashi's counters to Kakuzu's masks, and Shikamaru's quick analysis of Hidan's curse, even mentioning Shikamaru would have been a good bounty in the future. </pre>
