    <pre style="color: red;text-align: center;">Kisame Hoshigaki (干柿鬼鮫, Hoshigaki Kisame), 
        feared as the Monster of the Hidden Mist (霧隠れの怪人, Kirigakure no Kaijin), was a shinobi of Kirigakure's Hoshigaki Clan.
         After joining the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist,
         he became an S-rank missing-nin and was partnered with Itachi Uchiha when the latter joined Akatsuki.
         Originally, Kisame was to guard the Cypher Division under orders from his superior, Fuguki Suikazan of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.
          When the group was cornered by Konoha-nin under Ibiki Morino during a mission,
           Kisame chose to kill the Cypher Division members to keep their intel from being leaked out through Ibiki's interrogation,
            as instructed by Fuguki. </pre>
