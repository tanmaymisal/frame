    <pre style="color: red;text-align: center;">During his time as an Iwagakure shinobi, Deidara came to know Ōnoki, and became familiarised with his fighting style.
        He possessed the Explosion Release kekkei genkai which he used as a member of the Explosion Corps.
         Though praised highly for his clay sculptures, Deidara's desire to reach even greater heights in his art resulted with him stealing one of his village's kinjutsu that allows one to knead their chakra into substances.
          Using explosive clay to take out his pursuers, Deidara found the art he had desired: the Art of a Single Moment (一瞬の芸術, Isshun no Geijutsu).
          Remembering the first moment whenever he detonated his explosive clay, he recalls the process that allowed him to reach this art.
        Since then, Deidara became a missing-nin and offered his services as a bomber to insurgents in various countries.</pre>
