    <pre style="color: red;text-align: center;">Hidan (飛段, Hidan) is an S-rank missing-nin who defected from Yugakure and later joined the Akatsuki. 
        There, he was partnered with Kakuzu, despite the two's somewhat mutual dislike of each other. 
        He was also the second newest member of Akatsuki at the time of Tobi's introduction.
         Kisame Hoshigaki laughingly referred to Hidan and Kakuzu as the Zombie Combo (ゾンビコンビ, Zonbi Konbi, English TV: Zombie Pair).
         Hidan was a very foul-mouthed and disrespectful young man;
          he frequently used profanity and complained towards allies and opponents alike, despite being a "highly religious" person.
           He rarely used honourifics when speaking, and, even then, usually as a form of sarcasm, for example when he called Deidara "Deidara-chan".
            He was the only member of Akatsuki who did not respect their leader, Pain, and openly declared his willingness to kill him around others.
             The only respect he ever seemed to give was to his god, and, even then, he was quite willing to use his name as an insult and found some of the rituals and practices of his religion to be annoyingly tedious.
              He openly held his partner, Kakuzu, in contempt for his habit of blasphemy, love of money, and Kakuzu's frequent ridicule of Hidan's religion and battle style. 
              Despite this, whenever Hidan was in the mood to kill, the two worked together flawlessly in battle, and one can infer that he did care somewhat for his partner, from his panicked reaction when he almost killed Kakuzu while being possessed by Shikamaru's technique</pre>
