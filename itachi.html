     tachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. 
     He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke.
     He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki,whose activity brought him into
     frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.
     Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions
     were only ever in the interest  of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.

     Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha. His early childhood was marked with violence: 
     when he was four years old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand many of the war's casualties.
     The death and destruction he experienced at such a young age traumatised Itachi and made him a pacifist,[6] leading 
     to him training non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja in order to erase fighting from the world.
     [7] At age 5, after becoming a big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was approached by Shisui, who offered to train together.
     Soon, the two became best friends, forming a brother-like bond as they continued to teach the other new tricks.
     During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, he was home alone looking after Sasuke, followed by Itachi rescuing Mikoto
     from falling debris,[8] and in the anime seeking shelter with Izumi.[9] The Nine-Tails' attack had soured relations 
     between Konoha's leadership and the Uchiha, the former believing the latter to be responsible. The Uchiha were relocated
      to the edge of the village, isolating them from the rest of the village and making it easier to monitor them.
